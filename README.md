# Entrance-Exam-EDA
**Overview**

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), analysis, and regression tasks on a dataset related to *college entrance exam scores*. The dataset contains information about students' performance in math and verbal sections of the exam, as well as various demographic and academic factors such as family income, academic subjects studied, and GPA. The dataset comprises 74 columns and 

*I have added additional columns such as political affiliation, region, population, and GDP per capita to enhance the analysis.*

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

*Scores Vs Location Analysis*

**Regression Model**

A concise overview of the regression model:

- Verbal Scores vs. English GPA: Fits a linear regression model to predict verbal scores using English GPA and visualizes the actual vs. predicted values.
- Math Scores vs. Mathematics GPA: Similar to the first part, predicts math scores using mathematics GPA.
- Comparison of Regression Models: Splits the dataset into two time periods, builds separate regression models for each, and compares their performance.
- Evaluation: Calculates and prints the R-squared values to assess the model's goodness of fit.
